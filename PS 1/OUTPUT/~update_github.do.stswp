*We will run different balance tests for the given covariates: age educ black hisp nodegree re74 re75.\\ In order to understand the balance between the treatment and control groups for these different regressors we need to look at the p-value for the t ratio of interest which analyses under the null the hypothesis of no significant difference between the two coefficients computed from the two groups (treatment and control).\\
